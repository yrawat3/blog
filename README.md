BLOG
====
This is a project made using django. Using the admin feature, I am able to create multiple objects that are essentially the pages to my everday blog. And, through url routing, I am able to send the user to the page with all the information that a page of blog contains. The front-end is done with HTML and Python is used for the back-end.
